INFO: [ProjectBase 1-489] The host OS only allows 260 characters in a normal path. The project is stored in a path with more than 80 characters. If you experience issues with IP, Block Designs, or files not being found, please consider moving the project to a location with a shorter path. Alternately consider using the OS subst command to map part of the path to a drive letter.
Current project path is 'C:/Users/acbotto/Desktop/git/rec_teste_mohammedRashad/FPGA-Speech-Recognition-master'
